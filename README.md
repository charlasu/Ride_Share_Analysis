# Ride_Share_Analysis
Review "Pyber" ride share data to have an understanding of average fare across the number of rides and number of local drivers.


# Overview Comparison of 4 Variables
A quick bubble-plot glance shows that the data aligns to one's gut suspicions. Here we evaluate:
* Geographic Type: Urban, Suburban, and Rural (colors)
* Total Rides per Location (x-axis)
* Average Fare  per Location (y-axis)
* Number of Drivers per Location (size of bubbles)

This data proves a few things:
* Average Fare increases in suburan areas compared to urban environments and that fares in rural areas are higher than either suburban or urban income. *Assumption: there are greater distances between pick-up and drop-off*

* Number of Rides increases in suburban areas over rural geography and that urban locations have the greatest number of rides taken. *Assumption: there are more riders in locations with greater population density.*

* Much like the overall Number of Rides, Number of Drivers increases in suburban areas over rural geography and that urban locations have the greatest number of rides and drivers. *Assumption: there are more riders and drivers in Locations with greater population density.*

None of this is surprising; however, the insight that can be leveraged is to look more at suburban areas and focus marketing efforts on increasing ridership since a greater income will also increase the number of drivers. For a more in-depth look at the details, here's a table that shows each Location by Geographic Type.
